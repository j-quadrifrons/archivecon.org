					</header>
					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>In terms of attending the con itself, we will be using three different platforms: Discord, Zoom, and Twitch.</p>
<h3 id="discord">Discord</h3>
<p>This will be the main community hub: chat with fellow fans, receive announcements, have access to staff members, talk to individual Artist Alley contributors, play games, listen in on streams, etc. Consider this the hallway and info booth of an in-person con! As well, the Discord group will be open a week prior to the official con date, in order to let loose all those pre-con jitters and to deal with any questions attendees might have about panels, tech support, etc. The Discord will also stay open for a few weeks after the convention ends.</p>
<h3 id="zoom">Zoom</h3>
<p>We will be hosting the majority of our panels and activities here! Zoom is free to use for attendees. Each video has a chat section alongside, so attendees can talk about the panel or activity, and, if the panelist allows it, ask questions at the end. All attendees will be automatically muted when they join. If you&rsquo;d like to watch our panels live, we highly recommend you download Zoom before the convention starts. We will also be hosting a few practice sessions so attendees and panelists can get comfortable with the program.</p>
<h3 id="twitch">Twitch</h3>
<p>Similar to Zoom, this is another option for panelists to choose from, if they have their own channel. Attendees will be able to type chat alongside the video screen.</p>
<p>Remember - to get the full experience of the con, make sure you have a Discord account, and can access Twitch and Zoom. However, if you prefer a quieter, singular experience, that&rsquo;s fine too! All links to panels and activities will be emailed to registered attendees, so you don&rsquo;t need to join the Discord if you&rsquo;d prefer not to.</p>
<h2 id="rules-and-code-of-conduct">Rules and Code of Conduct</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must be 18 or over to attend; those found to be younger will be kicked from the convention.</li>
<li>Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated, and attendees acting disrespectfully or disruptively to other attendees or the mods is a bannable offense.</li>
<li>This is a judgment-free zone: severely dislike a ship, trope, kink, or character? Keep it to yourself! A light-hearted statement of preference is fine, but let’s keep the focus on things we do like! Any rudeness will not be tolerated.</li>
<li>Our panels will be given a NSFW tag if applicable, and panelists are free to choose content warnings. However, they are also free not to, so please ensure you curate your experience responsibly.</li>
<li>We are against harassment and fandom puritanism - if these do not align with your beliefs, then this may not be the convention for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you see any behaviour that breaks the above rules, or makes you uncomfortable, let us know! Either email us at <a href="mailto:info@archivecon.org">info@archivecon.org</a> message us on Bluesky or Tumblr, or @ one of the staff on Discord.</p>

<p>We will have a directory of artists, writers, and artisans (collectively henceforth known as AA Artists) right here on the site for you to peruse while attending ArchiveCon! ArCon welcomes all forms of art, so please don&rsquo;t be shy in applying. We will also have a section for those only taking commissions (of any sort) as well.</p>
<p>During the convention itself, each AA Artist (should they wish) will have their own Discord channel for attendees to chat and ask questions.</p>
<h2 id="rules-for-applying">Rules for applying</h2>
<ul>
<li>Please make sure your shop link works when applying</li>
<li>We will hopefully be able to accept everyone, but just in case there are too many applicants:
<ul>
<li>preference will be given to stores that ship internationally</li>
<li>we will judge based on quality of work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commissioners should have a separate site, like a Carrd or a well put-together google doc, with clear information and examples of their work</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>In respect to Rusty Quill&rsquo;s Creative Commons license, we will not be accepting applications from stores selling unofficial works based on RQ properties for profit; however, we will allow commissions and at-cost items</li>
<li>Due to the above restrictions, we fully accept any original or fandom works for other media!</li>
<li>Your store can remain open as it usually is in the lead-up to the convention</li>
<li>ArchiveCon holds no responsibility for purchases made off-site, and we assume that anyone making a purchase of NSFW art is 18+</li>

<p>Want to host a game, give a talk, organize a roundtable, or do something else fun at ArchiveCon? We&rsquo;ll be soliciting for programming soon! In the meantime, you can <a href="/home/services/past/">review some of our previous years&rsquo; events for inspiration</a>.</p>
<h3 id="panels">Panels</h3>
<p>Do you have a burning desire to share your theories? A need to dig into detailed character analyses? Got too deep into research for your fic, and now just have to tell everyone about Jonah-era occultism? This is where it&rsquo;s at! We welcome a wide variety of panel topics including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Magnus Archives/Magnus Protocol/RQ Network-themed topics, like deep dives into characters and meta</li>
<li>A focus on podcast-making, like sound editing, writing, or voice-acting, whether it be about TMA, another podcast, or a general overview</li>
<li>Fandom history</li>
<li>Queerness in fandom</li>
<li>Creative fannish endeavors, like zines, fic-binding, fanfic, fanart, etc</li>
<li>Round-table discussions</li>
<li>Friendly debates</li>
<li>Ship manifestos</li>
<li>Discussions and recommendations on similar media</li>
</ul>
<p>Panels can be done in a few different ways, depending on your comfort level! These can include: live and onscreen; live but off-screen, and instead sharing, say, a PowerPoint presentation; or even a prerecorded version of either of these. We can work with you to see what fits best. As well, panels will be done either on Zoom or through your own account on Twitch (if you&rsquo;re unsure, no worries! We&rsquo;ll keep in contact with panelists as time goes on to work everything out). Before the convention starts, we will email all attendees a copy of the schedule with links to each panel on whatever site the panelist chooses.</p>
<p>As well, in consideration for international attendees and/or those that like sleep, we will be giving panelists the option to record their panels! We will be placing them on a YouTube channel after the convention finishes, as a private link (emailed to registered attendees only). Depending on how many panels we have, it may take a week or two to get them uploaded.</p>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>All panels will be given a tag of NSFW or not (this rating will be up to the panelist), and if there are any trigger or content warnings that might apply; however, panelists can also negate this second option for whatever reason, and we will add a &ldquo;creator chose not to use warnings&rdquo; tag next to the panel description</li>
<li>Panel slots will mostly be slated for one hour; however, your panel may be shorter or longer if you&rsquo;d like. If so, please let us know as soon as you are able</li>
<li>We will require a technical check-in before your panel; please have the same equipment and tools you&rsquo;ll be using for your panel for this check!</li>
<li>All panels will have one moderator to monitor the chat as you are presenting</li>
<li>Multiple people may host the same panel</li>
<li>Unsure if your topic fits with the themes of the convention? Contact us through our email, Bluesky, or Tumblr, and we can work with you to see if it does!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="games-activities-and-workshops">Games, Activities, and Workshops</h3>
<p>Tired of learning, and just want to have a good time? Host a game! These can be party games on places like Steam or JackBox, or live interactive ones like Name that Tune (Fear?), quick cosplay challenges, quizzes, table-top rpg one-shots, story games, quick art/fic trades, etc! These games don&rsquo;t need to relate to the theme of the con - all are welcome.</p>
<p>Not tired of learning? Why not show us how to make a zine, or sew a simple doll! Workshops aren&rsquo;t quite like panels - as a workshop host, you&rsquo;ll have people creating along with you as you speak (whether it&rsquo;s prerecorded or not). We ask that if you host a workshop, you have a list of materials attendees will need on hand that we can give out prior to the convention.</p>
<h4 id="notes-1">Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Games can be anywhere from 1 - 3 hours long (lengthier slots mainly for ttrpg games); workshops between 1 - 1.5 hours</li>
<li>Games and workshop panels will have a moderator on hand to monitor the chat</li>
<li>Have an idea for an activity and not sure if it&rsquo;s accepted? Got an idea for something completely different? Feel free to ask us through email, Bluesky, or Tumblr!</li>

<h3 id="beat-your-face-like-it-owes-you-money-easy-cosplay-wounds--scars-for-the-non-makeup-artist">Beat Your Face (Like It Owes You Money): Easy Cosplay Wounds &amp; Scars For The Non-Makeup-Artist</h3>
<p>This panel will cover entry level, accessible methods for basic effects in bruising, light wounds, exhaustion/illness, good old extra eyeballs, and base contouring for cosplay photos.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: Hosta</li>
<li>Tags: Light gore</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-last-and-greatest-horror-death-jonah-and-the-jamesian-tradition">The Last and Greatest Horror: Death, Jonah, and the Jamesian Tradition</h3>
<p>In the canon of The Magnus Archives, death is a looming, ever present evil and the primary motivation behind Jonah’s machinations. While there are entities that briefly experience death and others who exist in death-like states, TMA doesn’t contain ghosts in the traditional sense. Despite taking inspiration from M.R. James’s ghost stories it paints a very different image of death, and this panel seeks to examine the ways the series draws from horror tradition to shape its greatest and final fear.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: statuscrows</li>
<li>Tags: Spoilers for the end of TMA; death and canon typical horror elements</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-are-jmart-so-blorbo">Why Are JMart So Blorbo?</h3>
<p>A reflection on what Jon and Martin and their relationship mean to me, trying to get to the bottom of why they’ve lived rent free in my brain for over two years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: AsTheJayFlies</li>
<li>Tags: Canon typical trauma; spoilers for the end of TMA</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creative-commons-wisdom">Creative Commons Wisdom</h3>
<p>You hear it after every episode of your favourite podcast, but do you know what all those words after &lsquo;a Creative Commons&rsquo; means? And more importantly, what does it mean to you? Join indie podcasting&rsquo;s works-for-cookies lawyer, Marguerite Kenner, for an introduction to the Creative Commons licenses, their history and elements, and how fans and creators alike can benefit from their motto &lsquo;when we share, everyone wins&rsquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: Marguerite Kenner</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i-really-love-jme-or-what-it-means-to-ship-a-rarepair-in-fandom">“I really love JME,” or, What It Means To Ship A Rarepair In Fandom</h3>
<p>Using the example of shipping Jon/Martin/Elias, this panel sought to explore what it feels like to love a rarepair in fandom, while acknowledging all the frustration and lonely feelings that can arise from it. It&rsquo;s also an enthusiastic manifesto for creating the content you would like to see for a ship you love, despite the apparent lack of an audience, and, perhaps, a subtle way to express how Jon/Martin/Elias is a very sexy ship, actually.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: RavenXavier</li>
<li>Tags: NSFW; spoilers for the end of TMA; creator chose not to use warnings</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-fan-studies-primer-for-fans">A Fan Studies Primer for Fans</h3>
<p>Fan studies is a field within academia that is constantly growing and expanding, but why should you, the fans, care about what a bunch of academics are saying? This panel provides a brief introduction to the state of the field and key theories, and it makes the argument that academic thought affects the real world, but especially in the case of fandom due to the close relationship between scholars and fans in the existence of the scholar-fan/fan-scholar/&ldquo;aca-fan.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: Ace J. (Phoebenavarro)</li>
<li>Tags: Discussions of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and stigma surrounding mental health issues both in a fandom context and within academia</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="britpicking-the-magnus-archives">Britpicking The Magnus Archives</h3>
<p>Why is it significant that Elias Bouchard got a 3rd in PPE from Christ Church college? How is the UK school system structured (and how would it have been during the time when Jon would have attended)? Why will Jon never wake up to the sound of cardinals outside his window? Zalia, a real live British person, will cover some of the basics. Bring your Britpicking questions!</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: Zalia Chimera</li>
<li>Tags: Spoilers for the end of TMA; possible political discussion and swearing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-themes-and-dynamics-of-jondaisy">The Themes and Dynamics of JonDaisy</h3>
<p>This will be a panel centered around Jonathan Sims and Daisy Tonner. We&rsquo;ll explore the textual examples of their relationship within the podcast, how their dynamic evolved over time, and how this is relevant to the themes of TMA. Discussions of meta and fan-focused thoughts will follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: Mx. Charming</li>
<li>Tags: Spoilers for the end of TMA; discussions will broadly include mentions of: police brutality, abuse/violence, kidnapping, attempted murder, childhood endangerment/trauma</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jonah-and-the-villain-of-a-thousand-faces">Jonah and the Villain of A Thousand Faces</h3>

<ul>
<li>Panelist: Nemo Martin</li>
<li>Tags: Discussions of enslavement, nineteenth century racism, taxidermy / animal death (no graphic images), mentions of war and injury, mentions of non-consensual relationships.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="make-your-statement-a-tma-oral-history">Make Your Statement: A TMA Oral History</h3>
<p>Fandoms can be life-changing: they&rsquo;re community, they&rsquo;re creative support and inspiration, they&rsquo;re an expression of joy (and, sometimes, of personality conflicts). From its very early days in 2016 to the explosion of 2020 and the unexpected resurrection of The Magnus Protocol, TMA fandom has been one hell of a ride. Join us for a panel-style discussion of the history of the fandom from our own points of view, and for information on how you can contribute to an oral history of TMA fandom as a whole.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: J. Quadrifrons | Flammen | Martyn</li>

<p>Gerry tells us that there are a number of different ways of classifying the Fears, but his mother and the Magnus Institute preferred Smirke&rsquo;s fourteen. What other ways exist, and what does their implied existence (and the OIAR manual in TMP) suggest about how the Fears interact and how they spread throughout the multiverse?</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="fan-studies-for-fans-recent-developments">Fan Studies for Fans: Recent Developments</h3>
