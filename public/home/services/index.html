					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>As a virtual convention, ArchiveCon takes place on Discord and Zoom.</p>
<h3 id="discord">Discord</h3>
<p>This will be the main community hub: chat with fellow fans, receive announcements, have access to staff members, talk to individual Artist Alley contributors, play games, listen in on streams, etc. Consider this the hallway and info booth of an in-person con! As well, the Discord group will be open a week prior to the official con date, in order to let loose all those pre-con jitters and to deal with any questions attendees might have about panels, tech support, etc. The Discord will also stay open for a few weeks after the convention ends.</p>
<h3 id="zoom">Zoom</h3>
<p>We will be hosting the majority of our panels and activities here! Zoom is free to use for attendees. Each video has a chat section alongside, so attendees can talk about the panel or activity, and, if the panelist allows it, ask questions at the end. All attendees will be automatically muted when they join. If you&rsquo;d like to watch our panels live, we highly recommend you download Zoom before the convention starts. We will also be hosting a few practice sessions so attendees and panelists can get comfortable with the program.</p>
<h2 id="rules-and-code-of-conduct">Rules and Code of Conduct</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must be 18 or over to attend; those found to be younger will be kicked from the convention.</li>
<li>Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated, and attendees acting disrespectfully or disruptively to other attendees or the mods is a bannable offense.</li>
<li>This is a judgment-free zone: severely dislike a ship, trope, kink, or character? Keep it to yourself! A light-hearted statement of preference is fine, but let’s keep the focus on things we do like! Any rudeness will not be tolerated.</li>
<li>Our panels will be given a NSFW tag if applicable, and panelists are free to choose content warnings. However, they are also free not to, so please ensure you curate your experience responsibly.</li>
<li>We are against harassment and fandom puritanism - if these do not align with your beliefs, then this may not be the convention for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you see any behaviour that breaks the above rules, or makes you uncomfortable, let us know! Either email us at <a href="mailto:archivecon@protonmail.com">archivecon@protonmail.com</a> message us on Bluesky or Tumblr, or @ one of the staff on Discord.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="beat-your-face-like-it-owes-you-money-easy-cosplay-wounds--scars-for-the-non-makeup-artist">Beat Your Face (Like It Owes You Money): Easy Cosplay Wounds &amp; Scars For The Non-Makeup-Artist</h3>
<p>This panel will cover entry level, accessible methods for basic effects in bruising, light wounds, exhaustion/illness, good old extra eyeballs, and base contouring for cosplay photos.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: Hosta</li>
<li>Tags: Light gore</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-last-and-greatest-horror-death-jonah-and-the-jamesian-tradition">The Last and Greatest Horror: Death, Jonah, and the Jamesian Tradition</h3>
<p>In the canon of The Magnus Archives, death is a looming, ever present evil and the primary motivation behind Jonah’s machinations. While there are entities that briefly experience death and others who exist in death-like states, TMA doesn’t contain ghosts in the traditional sense. Despite taking inspiration from M.R. James’s ghost stories it paints a very different image of death, and this panel seeks to examine the ways the series draws from horror tradition to shape its greatest and final fear.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: statuscrows</li>
<li>Tags: Spoilers for the end of TMA; death and canon typical horror elements</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-are-jmart-so-blorbo">Why Are JMart So Blorbo?</h3>
<p>A reflection on what Jon and Martin and their relationship mean to me, trying to get to the bottom of why they’ve lived rent free in my brain for over two years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: AsTheJayFlies</li>
<li>Tags: Canon typical trauma; spoilers for the end of TMA</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creative-commons-wisdom">Creative Commons Wisdom</h3>
<p>You hear it after every episode of your favourite podcast, but do you know what all those words after &lsquo;a Creative Commons&rsquo; means? And more importantly, what does it mean to you? Join indie podcasting&rsquo;s works-for-cookies lawyer, Marguerite Kenner, for an introduction to the Creative Commons licenses, their history and elements, and how fans and creators alike can benefit from their motto &lsquo;when we share, everyone wins&rsquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: Marguerite Kenner</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i-really-love-jme-or-what-it-means-to-ship-a-rarepair-in-fandom">“I really love JME,” or, What It Means To Ship A Rarepair In Fandom</h3>
<p>Using the example of shipping Jon/Martin/Elias, this panel sought to explore what it feels like to love a rarepair in fandom, while acknowledging all the frustration and lonely feelings that can arise from it. It&rsquo;s also an enthusiastic manifesto for creating the content you would like to see for a ship you love, despite the apparent lack of an audience, and, perhaps, a subtle way to express how Jon/Martin/Elias is a very sexy ship, actually.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: RavenXavier</li>
<li>Tags: NSFW; spoilers for the end of TMA; creator chose not to use warnings</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-fan-studies-primer-for-fans">A Fan Studies Primer for Fans</h3>
<p>Fan studies is a field within academia that is constantly growing and expanding, but why should you, the fans, care about what a bunch of academics are saying? This panel provides a brief introduction to the state of the field and key theories, and it makes the argument that academic thought affects the real world, but especially in the case of fandom due to the close relationship between scholars and fans in the existence of the scholar-fan/fan-scholar/&ldquo;aca-fan.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: Ace J. (Phoebenavarro)</li>
<li>Tags: Discussions of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and stigma surrounding mental health issues both in a fandom context and within academia</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="britpicking-the-magnus-archives">Britpicking The Magnus Archives</h3>
<p>Why is it significant that Elias Bouchard got a 3rd in PPE from Christ Church college? How is the UK school system structured (and how would it have been during the time when Jon would have attended)? Why will Jon never wake up to the sound of cardinals outside his window? Zalia, a real live British person, will cover some of the basics. Bring your Britpicking questions!</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: Zalia Chimera</li>
<li>Tags: Spoilers for the end of TMA; possible political discussion and swearing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-themes-and-dynamics-of-jondaisy">The Themes and Dynamics of JonDaisy</h3>
<p>This will be a panel centered around Jonathan Sims and Daisy Tonner. We&rsquo;ll explore the textual examples of their relationship within the podcast, how their dynamic evolved over time, and how this is relevant to the themes of TMA. Discussions of meta and fan-focused thoughts will follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: Mx. Charming</li>
<li>Tags: Spoilers for the end of TMA; discussions will broadly include mentions of: police brutality, abuse/violence, kidnapping, attempted murder, childhood endangerment/trauma</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jonah-and-the-villain-of-a-thousand-faces">Jonah and the Villain of A Thousand Faces</h3>

<ul>
<li>Panelist: Freetobeproblematic</li>
<li>Tags: NSFW; spoilers for the end of TMA; darker subject matter</li>
</ul>

<p>Nemo Martin leads a tour of the real people whose histories were the impetus behind the creation of the characters of Trice Forgotten.</p>
<ul>
<li>Panelist: Nemo Martin</li>
<li>Tags: Discussions of enslavement, nineteenth century racism, taxidermy / animal death (no graphic images), mentions of war and injury, mentions of non-consensual relationships.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="make-your-statement-a-tma-oral-history">Make Your Statement: A TMA Oral History</h3>
<p>Fandoms can be life-changing: they&rsquo;re community, they&rsquo;re creative support and inspiration, they&rsquo;re an expression of joy (and, sometimes, of personality conflicts). From its very early days in 2016 to the explosion of 2020 and the unexpected resurrection of The Magnus Protocol, TMA fandom has been one hell of a ride. Join us for a panel-style discussion of the history of the fandom from our own points of view, and for information on how you can contribute to an oral history of TMA fandom as a whole.</p>

<p>Gerry tells us that there are a number of different ways of classifying the Fears, but his mother and the Magnus Institute preferred Smirke&rsquo;s fourteen. What other ways exist, and what does their implied existence (and the OIAR manual in TMP) suggest about how the Fears interact and how they spread throughout the multiverse?</p>
