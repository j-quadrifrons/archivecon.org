ArchiveCon was started in 2022, as the Magnus Archives fandom was beginning to dwindle post-finale, and is dedicated to keeping that love alive. We are committed to being an online-only experience to be inclusive of all our time zones (and to keep costs down so we don't have to charge admission). While we do often have guests from Rusty Quill productions, we're not affiliated with the organization in any way--this is a by-fans, for-fans event!
