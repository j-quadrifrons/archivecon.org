Before registering, please review the Rules and Code of Conduct one more time:

## Rules and Code of Conduct

* You must be 18 or over to attend; those found to be younger will be kicked from the convention.
* Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated, and attendees acting disrespectfully or disruptively to other attendees or the mods is a bannable offense.
* This is a judgment-free zone: severely dislike a ship, trope, kink, or character? Keep it to yourself! A light-hearted statement of preference is fine, but let’s keep the focus on things we do like! Any rudeness will not be tolerated.
* Our panels will be given a NSFW tag if applicable, and panelists are free to choose content warnings. However, they are also free not to, so please ensure you curate your experience responsibly.
* We are against harassment and fandom puritanism - if these do not align with your beliefs, then this may not be the convention for you.

If you see any behaviour that breaks the above rules, or makes you uncomfortable, let us know! Either email us at {{< email >}}, message us on Bluesky or Tumblr, or @ one of the staff on Discord.

## Registration

Registration for ArchiveCon is completely free, and done through Eventbrite. However, we will not be accepting registrations during the event itself, so make sure you sign up early! 

Unsure if you can make the convention itself, or know that you can't get time off? No worries! Feel free to register anyways - this will grant you access to the Discord and any recorded panels that you can watch in your own time.

Once you’ve registered, keep up-to-date on any new info by following our twitter ([@archive_con](https://twitter.com/archive_con)) and tumblr ([@archivecon](https://archivecon.tumblr.com)). When we get closer to the final date, we will send out an email containing the convention schedule, as well as Discord invites, so the community can get hyped up beforehand!
