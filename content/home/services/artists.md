{{< applications >}}

We will have a directory of artists, writers, and artisans (collectively henceforth known as AA Artists) right here on the site for you to peruse while attending ArchiveCon! ArCon welcomes all forms of art, so please don't be shy in applying. We will also have a section for those only taking commissions (of any sort) as well.

During the convention itself, each AA Artist (should they wish) will have their own Discord channel for attendees to chat and ask questions.

## Rules for applying

* Please make sure your shop link works when applying
* We will hopefully be able to accept everyone, but just in case there are too many applicants:
  * preference will be given to stores that ship internationally
  * we will judge based on quality of work
* Commissioners should have a separate site, like a Carrd or a well put-together google doc, with clear information and examples of their work

### Notes

* In respect to Rusty Quill's Creative Commons license, we will not be accepting applications from stores selling unofficial works based on RQ properties for profit; however, we will allow commissions and at-cost items
* Due to the above restrictions, we fully accept any original or fandom works for other media!
* Your store can remain open as it usually is in the lead-up to the convention
* ArchiveCon holds no responsibility for purchases made off-site, and we assume that anyone making a purchase of NSFW art is 18+
