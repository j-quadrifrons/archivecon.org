In terms of attending the con itself, we will be using three different platforms: Discord, Zoom, and Twitch.

<!--more-->

### Discord

This will be the main community hub: chat with fellow fans, receive announcements, have access to staff members, talk to individual Artist Alley contributors, play games, listen in on streams, etc. Consider this the hallway and info booth of an in-person con! As well, the Discord group will be open a week prior to the official con date, in order to let loose all those pre-con jitters and to deal with any questions attendees might have about panels, tech support, etc. The Discord will also stay open for a few weeks after the convention ends.

### Zoom

We will be hosting the majority of our panels and activities here! Zoom is free to use for attendees. Each video has a chat section alongside, so attendees can talk about the panel or activity, and, if the panelist allows it, ask questions at the end. All attendees will be automatically muted when they join. If you'd like to watch our panels live, we highly recommend you download Zoom before the convention starts. We will also be hosting a few practice sessions so attendees and panelists can get comfortable with the program. 

### Twitch

Similar to Zoom, this is another option for panelists to choose from, if they have their own channel. Attendees will be able to type chat alongside the video screen.

Remember - to get the full experience of the con, make sure you have a Discord account, and can access Twitch and Zoom. However, if you prefer a quieter, singular experience, that's fine too! All links to panels and activities will be emailed to registered attendees, so you don't need to join the Discord if you'd prefer not to.

## Rules and Code of Conduct

* You must be 18 or over to attend; those found to be younger will be kicked from the convention.
* Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated, and attendees acting disrespectfully or disruptively to other attendees or the mods is a bannable offense.
* This is a judgment-free zone: severely dislike a ship, trope, kink, or character? Keep it to yourself! A light-hearted statement of preference is fine, but letâ€™s keep the focus on things we do like! Any rudeness will not be tolerated.
* Our panels will be given a NSFW tag if applicable, and panelists are free to choose content warnings. However, they are also free not to, so please ensure you curate your experience responsibly.
* We are against harassment and fandom puritanism - if these do not align with your beliefs, then this may not be the convention for you.

If you see any behaviour that breaks the above rules, or makes you uncomfortable, let us know! Either email us at {{< email >}} message us on Bluesky or Tumblr, or @ one of the staff on Discord.
