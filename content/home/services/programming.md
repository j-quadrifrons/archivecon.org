Want to host a game, give a talk, organize a roundtable, or do something else fun at ArchiveCon? We'll be soliciting for programming soon! In the meantime, you can [review some of our previous years' events for inspiration]({{< relref "past" >}}).

### Panels
Do you have a burning desire to share your theories? A need to dig into detailed character analyses? Got too deep into research for your fic, and now just have to tell everyone about Jonah-era occultism? This is where it's at! We welcome a wide variety of panel topics including, but not limited to:

* The Magnus Archives/Magnus Protocol/RQ Network-themed topics, like deep dives into characters and meta
* A focus on podcast-making, like sound editing, writing, or voice-acting, whether it be about TMA, another podcast, or a general overview
* Fandom history
* Queerness in fandom
* Creative fannish endeavors, like zines, fic-binding, fanfic, fanart, etc
* Round-table discussions
* Friendly debates
* Ship manifestos
* Discussions and recommendations on similar media

Panels can be done in a few different ways, depending on your comfort level! These can include: live and onscreen; live but off-screen, and instead sharing, say, a PowerPoint presentation; or even a prerecorded version of either of these. We can work with you to see what fits best. As well, panels will be done either on Zoom or through your own account on Twitch (if you're unsure, no worries! We'll keep in contact with panelists as time goes on to work everything out). Before the convention starts, we will email all attendees a copy of the schedule with links to each panel on whatever site the panelist chooses.

As well, in consideration for international attendees and/or those that like sleep, we will be giving panelists the option to record their panels! We will be placing them on a YouTube channel after the convention finishes, as a private link (emailed to registered attendees only). Depending on how many panels we have, it may take a week or two to get them uploaded.

#### Notes

* All panels will be given a tag of NSFW or not (this rating will be up to the panelist), and if there are any trigger or content warnings that might apply; however, panelists can also negate this second option for whatever reason, and we will add a "creator chose not to use warnings" tag next to the panel description
* Panel slots will mostly be slated for one hour; however, your panel may be shorter or longer if you'd like. If so, please let us know as soon as you are able
* We will require a technical check-in before your panel; please have the same equipment and tools you'll be using for your panel for this check!
* All panels will have one moderator to monitor the chat as you are presenting
* Multiple people may host the same panel
* Unsure if your topic fits with the themes of the convention? Contact us through our email, Bluesky, or Tumblr, and we can work with you to see if it does!

### Games, Activities, and Workshops

Tired of learning, and just want to have a good time? Host a game! These can be party games on places like Steam or JackBox, or live interactive ones like Name that Tune (Fear?), quick cosplay challenges, quizzes, table-top rpg one-shots, story games, quick art/fic trades, etc! These games don't need to relate to the theme of the con - all are welcome.

Not tired of learning? Why not show us how to make a zine, or sew a simple doll! Workshops aren't quite like panels - as a workshop host, you'll have people creating along with you as you speak (whether it's prerecorded or not). We ask that if you host a workshop, you have a list of materials attendees will need on hand that we can give out prior to the convention.

#### Notes

* Games can be anywhere from 1 - 3 hours long (lengthier slots mainly for ttrpg games); workshops between 1 - 1.5 hours
* Games and workshop panels will have a moderator on hand to monitor the chat
* Have an idea for an activity and not sure if it's accepted? Got an idea for something completely different? Feel free to ask us through email, Bluesky, or Tumblr!
