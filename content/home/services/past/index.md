### The Last and Greatest Horror: Death, Jonah, and the Jamesian Tradition
In the canon of The Magnus Archives, death is a looming, ever present evil and the primary motivation behind Jonah’s machinations. While there are entities that briefly experience death and others who exist in death-like states, TMA doesn’t contain ghosts in the traditional sense. Despite taking inspiration from M.R. James’s ghost stories it paints a very different image of death, and this panel seeks to examine the ways the series draws from horror tradition to shape its greatest and final fear.
* Panelist: statuscrows
* Tags: Spoilers for the end of TMA; death and canon typical horror elements

### Why Are JMart So Blorbo?

* Panelist: AsTheJayFlies
* Tags: Canon typical trauma; spoilers for the end of TMA

### Creative Commons Wisdom
You hear it after every episode of your favourite podcast, but do you know what all those words after 'a Creative Commons' means? And more importantly, what does it mean to you? Join indie podcasting's works-for-cookies lawyer, Marguerite Kenner, for an introduction to the Creative Commons licenses, their history and elements, and how fans and creators alike can benefit from their motto 'when we share, everyone wins'.
* Panelist: Marguerite Kenner

### “I really love JME,” or, What It Means To Ship A Rarepair In Fandom
Using the example of shipping Jon/Martin/Elias, this panel sought to explore what it feels like to love a rarepair in fandom, while acknowledging all the frustration and lonely feelings that can arise from it. It's also an enthusiastic manifesto for creating the content you would like to see for a ship you love, despite the apparent lack of an audience, and, perhaps, a subtle way to express how Jon/Martin/Elias is a very sexy ship, actually.
* Panelist: RavenXavier
* Tags: NSFW; spoilers for the end of TMA; creator chose not to use warnings
 
### A Fan Studies Primer for Fans
Fan studies is a field within academia that is constantly growing and expanding, but why should you, the fans, care about what a bunch of academics are saying? This panel provides a brief introduction to the state of the field and key theories, and it makes the argument that academic thought affects the real world, but especially in the case of fandom due to the close relationship between scholars and fans in the existence of the scholar-fan/fan-scholar/"aca-fan."
* Panelist: Ace J. (Phoebenavarro)
* Tags: Discussions of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and stigma surrounding mental health issues both in a fandom context and within academia

### Britpicking The Magnus Archives
Why is it significant that Elias Bouchard got a 3rd in PPE from Christ Church college? How is the UK school system structured (and how would it have been during the time when Jon would have attended)? Why will Jon never wake up to the sound of cardinals outside his window? Zalia, a real live British person, will cover some of the basics. Bring your Britpicking questions!
* Panelist: Zalia Chimera
* Tags: Spoilers for the end of TMA; possible political discussion and swearing

### Make Your Statement: A TMA Oral History
Fandoms can be life-changing: they're community, they're creative support and inspiration, they're an expression of joy (and, sometimes, of personality conflicts). From its very early days in 2016 to the explosion of 2020 and the unexpected resurrection of The Magnus Protocol, TMA fandom has been one hell of a ride. Join us for a panel-style discussion of the history of the fandom from our own points of view, and for information on how you can contribute to an oral history of TMA fandom as a whole.
