## What is ArchiveCon?

This is an adults-only, online-only, mini convention that was spurred on by our love of podcasts (mainly TMA, but all sorts of others as well!) and all the marginalia fandom has to offer - from fanfiction to fanart, podfic to bookbinding, to the minutiae of sound editing and stitching - anything you enjoy goes! We aim to foster the spirit of creativity, learning, and freedom of expression.

Like any convention, there’ll be panels, discussion groups, an artist alley, streaming, and games - there’s a little something for everyone!

ArchiveCon will have a strong Magnus Archives/Magnus Protocol bent, but we encourage fans of other Rusty Quill productions, outside audio dramas, and fandom-goers in general to join in as well!

## Is the convention adults-only?

Yes. You must be 18 or older to attend the convention. However, this does not mean that panels and other activities will all be NSFW - this adults-only rule is merely to give our panelists and attendees more freedom in whatever they wish to discuss. 

## Is it free?

It sure is! All you’ll need is time and access to Discord, Zoom, and/or Twitch.

## What timezone will you be in? And what are the hours?

ArchiveCon is based in Eastern Daylight Time. To accommodate our international attendees, we allow panels to be held at any time during convention hours, and most panels will be recorded for later viewing. In 2025, the con will be held from {{< condate >}}, opening at 4pm EDT on Friday and closing at 6pm EDT on Sunday.

## Where can I watch recorded panels?

Recorded panels will be uploaded to a private YouTube channel a few weeks after the convention finishes. All attendees will be emailed links to the channel.

## Is this associated with Rusty Quill?
Nope! ArchiveCon is simply a by fans, for fans endeavor - completely non-profit, entirely for fun!
